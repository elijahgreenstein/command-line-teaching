Command Line Teaching
============================================================

Command Line Teaching (CLT) is a command line toolkit written in Python that enables instructors to develop online course materials quickly from a set of plain text files. The command line interface simplifies the organization of modules, the creation of course materials from templates, and their upload to an online learning management system (`Canvas LMS by Instructure <canvas_lms_>`__) through API calls.

Follow the "Tutorial" for a basic introduction to the CLT toolkit. Refer to the "How-to" guides for more advanced customization and to the "Reference" material for additional information about how the toolkit works.
